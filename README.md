SKU Rationalization is part of product lifecycle management where we apply the 80/20.

80/20 rule implies 80% of value are derived from 20% of the product SKUs

Since inefficient products consume the same resources as efficient products, rationalization focuses on relative value.

The ABC portion of the analysis represents a turnover rate by quantity sold and cost.  Directionally, the worst product (C) has high costs, but low turnover.  Whereas the more efficient products, turnover fast and achieve higher revenue.

The XYZ of the analysis represents variance involved with consumer demand.  A product with zero variance in demand is 100% predictable which means high efficiencies in managing supply chains and inventories.  Products with high variable demand create challenges in optimum Efficient Order Quantity (EOQ).  Although more sophisticated demand prediction models may not be impacted variable demand, the XYZ model does not factor these into the mix.  In summary, X products have low relative variance and Z products possess high variable demand.

The P1-P3 part of the analysis, represents SKU profitability where P1 is the most profitable and P3 the least profitable.

Rationalization segmentation.  Each SKU can be described by a three letter code (e.g. A, Z, P3).  The top segment would have high turnover (A), low variance of demand (X) and high profitability (P1)

In summary, SKU rationalization is both an art and science.
